        <p id="photography"> I was fortunate enough to be approached by an editor for a magazine who was working on a piece about local photographers defining their legacy through lenses. 
          This image I took of my friend was a stunning silhouette sunset photo. It was a breathtaking moment that I knew I had to capture, and so I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped the shot. 
          The resulting image was a beautiful representation of the natural beauty around us, and it was this experience that sparked my passion for capturing stunning photographs of the world around me.
