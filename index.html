        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm so happy you found my portfolio, and I hope you like it.
           My portfolio will be used as a tool for reflection as I examine the struggles I had and the numerous successes that outnumbered my setbacks both inside and outside the classroom. 
          You may also view some of my other interests when you visit my portfolio. 
          You also get to understand a little bit about myself, my objectives for the near future and the far off future, as well as some of the numerous life lessons that I have acquired outside of the classroom and which have helped to mold me into the person I am today.</p>
